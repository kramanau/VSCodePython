### An attempt to become more familiar with git while using VSCode.

`git init` : creates a new local repo

`git commit -m "commit message"` : commits changes to local with message

`git push origin master` : push changes to master branch of remote repo

`git remote add origin <server>` : connects local repo to remote repo server

`git status` : lists files with changes and still need adding or commiting

`git clone /path/to/repo` : clone a repository 

`git checkout -b <branchname>` : create a new branch and switch to it

`git checkout <branchname>` : switch to branchname

`git branch` : list branches in repo and current branch

`git push origin <branchname>` : push branch to remote repo

`git pull` : fetch and merge changes from remote repo to local

`git diff` : view merge conflicts

`git add <filename>` : after resolving conflicts, mark the file as changed
